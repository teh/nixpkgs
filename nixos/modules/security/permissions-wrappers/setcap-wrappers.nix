        This option sets capabilities on a wrapper program that
        propagates those capabilities down to the wrapped, real
        program.

        The `program` attribute is the name of the program to be
        wrapped. If no `source` attribute is provided, specifying the
        absolute path to the program, then the program will be
        searched for in the path environment variable.

        NOTE: cap_setpcap, which is required for the wrapper program
        to be able to raise caps into the Ambient set is NOT raised to
        the Ambient set so that the real program cannot modify its own
        capabilities!! This may be too restrictive for cases in which
        the real program needs cap_setpcap but it at least leans on
        the side security paranoid vs. too relaxed.

        The attribute `setcap` defaults to false and it will create a
        wrapper program but never set the capability set on it. This
        is done so that you can remove a capability sent entirely from
        a wrapper program without also needing to go change any
        absolute paths that may be directly referencing the wrapper
        program.
